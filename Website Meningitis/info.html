         <p>Meningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the lining covering the brain and/or spinal cord, which can lead to a stiff neck, headache, fever and drowsiness, or, more seriously, coma or death.
                Bacterial infections such as meningococcus, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b and listeria can cause meningitis.
                </p>
                <p>If you have close contact with a person who has viral meningitis, you may become infected with the virus that made that person sick. However, you are not likely to develop meningitis. That’s because only a small number of people who get infected with the viruses that cause meningitis will actually develop viral meningitis.
                    </p>
