    <p id="chris"> “I was so young when this happened. Man… I know I’ll never forget that day”.
        As I looked at Mr. John Wilkinson, the town loon with a sense of impatiens and boredom I quickly encouraged him to tell his tale. “ Yes I understand that Mr. Wilkinson, but would you mind hurrying up? This is the last story I have to cover today and I really wanna get home”. He sat there in his rotten wooden chair, in a crusty yellow stained white T-shirt, and tan cargo shorts, staring at me with a look of bliss and furry. I was quite interesting, but I didn't have time to get into any altercations with this man. I only had one more day to come up with a report that would save me from losing my job. “Be quite and let me talk then”  he said with a slight hint of anxiety and anger. “I’m not sure if I have much time left so let me finish.”</p>

<p id=holland>I nodded silently as I waited for him to continue. With a journal and pen  my hands, along with a tape recorded on the stained glass table next to old Wilkinson I felt ready to hear him out. “So where should I begin?” he looked up at the ceiling as if he was if he were in a deep train of thought the snapped back to look at me. “I’ve got it” he said with a yellow toothed smile on his face. “ As I said before I was young when this first happen. I believe that I was around sixteen at the time. I first started hearing the voices in my closet”. I rolled my eyes secretly thinking to myself “Here we go another nut case, that needs to end up in  a white room”.I looked back at him as he continued to ignore my attitude and go on with his story. </p2>
