    <p id="chris"> “I was so young when this happened. Man… I know I’ll never forget that day”. As I looked at Mr. John Wilkinson, the town
        loon with a sense of impatiens and boredom I quickly encouraged him to tell his tale. “ Yes I understand that Mr.
        Wilkinson, but would you mind hurrying up? This is the last story I have to cover today and I really wanna get home”.
        He sat there in his rotten wooden chair, in a crusty yellow stained white T-shirt, and tan cargo shorts, staring
        at me with a look of bliss and furry. I was quite interesting, but I didn't have time to get into any altercations
        with this man. I only had one more day to come up with a report that would save me from losing my job. “Be quite
        and let me talk then” he said with a slight hint of anxiety and anger. “I’m not sure if I have much time left so
        let me finish.”</p>

    <p id=holland>I nodded silently as I waited for him to continue. With a journal and pen my hands, along with a tape recorded on the
        stained glass table next to old Wilkinson I felt ready to hear him out. “So where should I begin?” he looked up at
        the ceiling as if he was if he were in a deep train of thought the snapped back to look at me. “I’ve got it” he said
        with a yellow toothed smile on his face. “ As I said before I was young when this first happen. I believe that I
        was around sixteen at the time. I first started hearing the voices in my closet”. I rolled my eyes secretly thinking
        to myself “Here we go another nut case, that needs to end up in a white room”.I looked back at him as he continued
        to ignore my attitude and go on with his story. </p2> <!-- TODO:  Fix this </p2> tag -->
