Portfolio final grade: 77

Comments:  This was a decent effort.  I see that you tried to do more with the HTML than just the bare minimum - in some places it worked, and in others it caused problems.   Try to review the notes and the ToDo items I left for you in the earlier grading to understand where you can improve.
